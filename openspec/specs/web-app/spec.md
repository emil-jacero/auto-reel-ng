# web-app Specification

## Purpose

The browser client for the auto-reel-ng service: how it is built, how its view of the API is derived
from the service's own schema rather than hand-written, and what it is allowed to depend on.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The client is a static build with no runtime Node process
The web client SHALL be built ahead of time into static assets that the existing service process serves.
No part of running the service may require Node, a JavaScript runtime, or a second server process: a
deployment SHALL remain the single Python process `auto-reel serve` starts. Node MAY be required to
*build* the client, and that toolchain SHALL run in a container rather than being installed on the host.

#### Scenario: The service runs with no Node present
- **WHEN** the service is started on a host that has no Node installed, from a checkout whose client was
  built elsewhere
- **THEN** the service starts and serves the client

#### Scenario: Building the client installs nothing on the host
- **WHEN** a developer builds the client from a clean checkout
- **THEN** the build runs inside a container and leaves no Node toolchain installed on the host

### Requirement: API types are generated from the service's own schema
The client's TypeScript types for API requests and responses SHALL be generated from the service's
OpenAPI schema, and MUST NOT be hand-written or hand-maintained. The schema SHALL be produced from the
application itself, offline — without a running service, a reachable database, or network access — and
SHALL be committed to the repository alongside the types generated from it, so that both the Python and
the TypeScript checks can compare against a fixed artifact.

#### Scenario: The schema is produced without a running service
- **WHEN** the schema is generated on a machine with no database reachable and no service running
- **THEN** the schema is produced successfully and describes the API's current endpoints and models

#### Scenario: Types are derived, never authored
- **WHEN** a developer needs the type of an API response in client code
- **THEN** it is available from the generated types, and no equivalent shape is declared by hand

### Requirement: A backend schema change fails a check, never drifts silently
A change to any endpoint's request or response model SHALL cause a check to fail until the committed
schema and generated types are regenerated. The Python test suite SHALL fail when the committed schema
does not match the schema the application currently produces, naming the disagreement. The client's
type-check SHALL fail when client code uses a field or shape the generated types do not describe.

#### Scenario: A response model gains a field
- **WHEN** a field is added to an endpoint's response model and the committed schema is not regenerated
- **THEN** the Python test suite fails, reporting that the committed schema is out of date

#### Scenario: A response model loses a field the client reads
- **WHEN** a field the client reads is removed from an endpoint's response model, and the schema and
  types are regenerated
- **THEN** the client's type-check fails at the place that reads the removed field

#### Scenario: Regenerating clears the failure
- **WHEN** the committed schema and generated types are regenerated after a backend model change
- **THEN** both checks pass with no hand edit to the generated files

### Requirement: The type-check is the frontend's gate
`tsc --noEmit` SHALL be the check the client must pass, and the project SHALL NOT require a frontend
test runner or browser automation for GUI v1. Adding either later requires its own justified proposal.

#### Scenario: The client is checked without a browser
- **WHEN** the client's validation is run
- **THEN** it type-checks the client and requires no browser, headless or otherwise

### Requirement: The dependency budget is explicit and small
The client SHALL depend on React, React DOM, Vite, the Vite React plugin and TypeScript, plus the
schema-to-types generator as a development dependency. It MUST NOT depend on a component library, a CSS
framework, a router, or a state-management or data-fetching library at GUI v1. Any dependency beyond
this set SHALL be justified in the proposal of the change that introduces it, by a slice that
demonstrably needs it.

#### Scenario: A slice needs a capability no budgeted dependency provides
- **WHEN** a later slice requires drag-and-drop reordering
- **THEN** that slice's proposal justifies the one library it adds, rather than it appearing as an
  incidental dependency of this scaffold

### Requirement: Development serves the client and the API from one origin
In development the client SHALL be served by its own dev server, which SHALL forward API and WebSocket
requests to the running service, so that client code addresses the API by path alone. The client MUST
NOT be configured with an absolute API base URL, and the service MUST NOT need cross-origin permissions
for the client to work in development or in production.

#### Scenario: The client calls the API in development
- **WHEN** the dev server is running against a running service and the client requests an API path
- **THEN** the request reaches the service and succeeds without any cross-origin configuration

#### Scenario: The same client code works when served by the service
- **WHEN** the built client is served by the service itself
- **THEN** the same API paths resolve against the serving origin, with no build-time URL substitution

### Requirement: The event list shows every event with its render state

The client's first screen SHALL list every event the events list response returns. Events SHALL be grouped
by the year of their date, groups newest year first, and events within a group newest date first. Events
with no date SHALL form their own group after every dated group. Each event SHALL show:

- its date
- its title, or the event's folder name when it has no title
- its location when it has one
- its clip count
- its NEW and MISSING clip counts when either is non-zero
- whether it needs a render and, if so, every reason the verdict cites, in words
- its latest job's status, when it has one

The screen MUST NOT omit an event the response contains, invent a fact the response does not carry, or
present a missing fact (no date, no title, no job) as a value.

#### Scenario: A multi-year library is grouped newest first
- **WHEN** the list contains events dated in 2023 and 2024 and one event with no date
- **THEN** the 2024 group appears first, then 2023, then the undated group, and each dated group is ordered
  newest date first

#### Scenario: An untitled event is shown by its folder name
- **WHEN** an event has no title in its metadata
- **THEN** it is shown under its event folder's name, not as an empty row or "Untitled"

#### Scenario: A stale event names every reason
- **WHEN** an event was renamed after its last render, so its verdict cites the editorial change and the
  missing output
- **THEN** its row says it needs a render and names both reasons in words

#### Scenario: NEW and MISSING clips are visible
- **WHEN** an event has one NEW clip, and another references one clip that is absent from disk
- **THEN** the first row shows one new clip and the second shows one missing clip

#### Scenario: The latest job's outcome is visible
- **WHEN** one event's latest job failed, another's is queued, and a third has no job
- **THEN** the first row shows the failure, the second shows that it is queued, and the third shows no job
  status at all

### Requirement: The event list answers what needs rendering, from disk

The screen SHALL state how many of the listed events need a render, out of how many readable events in
total, and, when any exist, how many events need attention because they are error rows. It SHALL offer a
choice between showing all events and showing only the events needing a render. Error rows SHALL remain
visible whatever the choice, because they also need action.

The screen SHALL read the list from the service:

- when it is first shown
- whenever the operator refreshes it
- whenever it is shown and the client has recorded, since the list was last read, that an event changed
  (for example a save on an event page, or a finished render)

It MUST NOT cache a list across refreshes, or derive freshness from anything but the verdict the response
carries: a completed job is not freshness.

#### Scenario: The summary counts stale events
- **WHEN** the list holds nine events of which six need a render
- **THEN** the screen states that 6 of 9 events need rendering

#### Scenario: The filter hides fresh events
- **WHEN** the operator switches the list to show only events that need a render
- **THEN** only events whose verdict is stale remain listed, still grouped and ordered as before

#### Scenario: A refresh shows disk changes
- **WHEN** a clip is added to a fresh event's folder and the operator refreshes
- **THEN** that event is shown as needing a render, citing the changed clips, and with one new clip

#### Scenario: A finished job does not make an event fresh
- **WHEN** an event's latest job is done but its clips changed afterwards
- **THEN** the event is shown as needing a render

#### Scenario: Events needing attention are counted separately
- **WHEN** the list holds nine summaries, six of them stale, and one error row
- **THEN** the screen states that 6 of 9 events need rendering and that 1 needs attention

#### Scenario: The filter keeps error rows
- **WHEN** the operator switches the list to only events needing a render, over a list that contains an
  error row
- **THEN** the error row remains shown in "Needs attention"

#### Scenario: An event changed in the client is re-read on return
- **WHEN** the list was read, the operator opened `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the client recorded
  that this event changed, and the operator goes back to the list
- **THEN** the list is read again, and the Needs render choice is as the operator left it

### Requirement: The event list reports failures by cause

When the list cannot be read at all, the screen SHALL say why, distinguishing:

- the service being unable to reach its database
- the project scan failing as a whole
- the service not answering at all

It SHALL take these distinctions from the published problem body, not from its prose. A failed read SHALL
replace any previously shown list: the screen MUST NOT keep showing an earlier list as though it were
current. It MUST NOT show a partial list.

When the list is read but contains **error rows**, the screen SHALL show every other event as usual, plus
a **"Needs attention"** group placed before all other groups. For each error row, the group SHALL show:

- the event's folder name
- its failure kind in words
- the service's detail, which states the fix

An error row SHALL never be presented as a render-state row, and no fact the row does not carry (clip
counts, staleness, title, date) SHALL be shown for it.

#### Scenario: The database is down
- **WHEN** the service answers the list with its database-failure problem body
- **THEN** the screen says the service cannot reach its database, and shows no events

#### Scenario: An event cannot be scanned
- **WHEN** the list holds eight summaries and one error row for `2019-04-31 - Golfträning med Emil - Tjörn`
  with the unusable-metadata kind
- **THEN** the screen shows the eight events in their year groups, and a "Needs attention" group first
  showing that folder name, the kind in words, and the detail that `2019-04-31` is not a real date

#### Scenario: The service is down
- **WHEN** the request gets no response from the service
- **THEN** the screen says the service is not reachable

#### Scenario: A refresh fails after a successful load
- **WHEN** a list was shown and a refresh then fails
- **THEN** the earlier list is no longer shown, and the failure is

#### Scenario: The whole scan fails
- **WHEN** the service answers the list with its scan-failure problem body
- **THEN** the screen says the project could not be scanned, shows the detail, and shows no events

### Requirement: Screen labels are exhaustive over the generated vocabularies

Every staleness reason, every job status, every event failure kind and every clip status the screens show
SHALL be put into words through a mapping defined over the generated types' union for that vocabulary. The
client's type-check then fails when a vocabulary gains, loses or renames a member that the mapping does not
match. The screens MUST NOT display a reason, status or kind slug verbatim, and MUST NOT fall back to one for
an unrecognized value.

#### Scenario: A new staleness reason fails the build
- **WHEN** a staleness reason is added to the engine, and the schema and client types are regenerated
- **THEN** the client's type-check fails at the reason mapping until the new reason is given words

#### Scenario: A renamed job status fails the build
- **WHEN** a job status is renamed and the schema and client types are regenerated
- **THEN** the client's type-check fails at the job status mapping

#### Scenario: A new failure kind fails the build
- **WHEN** an event failure kind is added to the service, and the schema and client types are regenerated
- **THEN** the client's type-check fails at the failure-kind mapping until the new kind is given words

#### Scenario: A new clip status fails the build
- **WHEN** a clip status is added to the engine, and the schema and client types are regenerated
- **THEN** the client's type-check fails at the clip-status mapping until the new status is given words

### Requirement: Each event opens on its own page

Every event the list shows with its render state SHALL link to that event's page. The page's address SHALL
identify the event, so that:

- the browser's Back and Forward move between the list and event pages
- reloading an event page reopens the same event
- an event page's address can be bookmarked and opened directly

Returning from an event page to the list SHALL show the list as it was left, with the same filter setting and
the same scroll position, and SHALL NOT re-read the list from the service. The one exception is when the
client has recorded, since the list was last read, that an event changed. In that case the list SHALL be
read again on return, keeping its filter setting. Otherwise, the list is read only when it
is first shown and when the operator refreshes it. An address the client does not recognize SHALL show the
list. Navigation SHALL add no dependency: the client MUST NOT gain a router library.

#### Scenario: An event row opens its page
- **WHEN** the operator clicks the title of `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna` in the list
- **THEN** that event's page is shown, and the address identifies that event

#### Scenario: Back returns to the list as it was
- **WHEN** the operator filtered the list to events that need rendering, scrolled down, opened an event, and
  then pressed Back, and no event was recorded as changed in between
- **THEN** the list is shown with the filter still on and at the same scroll position, and no new list
  request was made

#### Scenario: An event page survives a reload
- **WHEN** the operator reloads the browser on an event's page, or opens a bookmark of it in a new tab
- **THEN** that event's page is shown

#### Scenario: Event identities with spaces, slashes and non-ASCII letters work
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024/2024-04-20 - Lasse 80 år, M-A och Lasse kärleksförklaring - Kungälv`
- **THEN** its page is shown, and its address round-trips through Back, Forward and reload

#### Scenario: An unrecognized address shows the list
- **WHEN** the address names no known page, for example `#/nonsense`
- **THEN** the list is shown

### Requirement: The event page shows the event's chapters and clips

An event's page SHALL show, from the event detail the service returns:

- the event's title, or its folder name when it has no title, with its date, location and description
  when present
- whether it needs a render, with every reason in words, or that it is up to date
- its latest job's status and time, when it has one
- counts of its clips, their total size, and its new, missing and ignored clips

Each chapter SHALL be shown as a table, in the order the service returns, with the default chapter's clips
under the label `Main` when the event also has named chapters. Each clip SHALL be listed in play order, with
its position in the chapter, its file name, its status in words, its size and its modification time. A clip
the service reports without a size or time (a missing clip) SHALL show those as absent, never as zero or a
placeholder date. When `reel.yaml` lists clips that are missing from disk, the page SHALL name them in a
warning above the chapters.

The page SHALL read the event from the service when it opens and whenever the operator refreshes it.

#### Scenario: Chapters and clips appear in play order
- **WHEN** an event has root clips and a `Kvällen` chapter
- **THEN** the page shows a `Main` table and a `Kvällen` table, each listing its clips in the order the
  service returns, numbered from 1

#### Scenario: Every clip status is visible
- **WHEN** an event has an included clip, a NEW clip in a named chapter, a MISSING clip and an IGNORED clip
- **THEN** each is listed in its chapter with its status in words, and the counts line reports one new, one
  missing and one ignored clip

#### Scenario: A missing clip shows no invented facts
- **WHEN** `reel.yaml` lists `borttagen.mp4` and the file is not on disk
- **THEN** its row shows no size and no time, and a warning above the chapters names `borttagen.mp4`

#### Scenario: A stale event says why
- **WHEN** an event's `reel.yaml` was edited after its last render
- **THEN** the page shows that it needs a render, citing the edit in words

#### Scenario: A large event is fully listed
- **WHEN** an event holds 380 clips in one chapter
- **THEN** all 380 are listed, numbered 1 to 380

### Requirement: The event page reports failures by cause

When an event's page cannot show the event, it SHALL say why, taking the distinction from the published
problem body, not from its prose:

- **an unknown event**, for example a stale bookmark: the page says the event was not found under the project
  root, and offers the way back to the list
- **an event the service cannot read**: the page shows the failure kind in the same words the list's "Needs
  attention" group uses, and the service's detail, which states the fix
- **the service being unable to reach its database**
- **the service not answering at all**

A failed read SHALL replace whatever the page showed before. It MUST NOT keep showing an earlier state of the
event as though it were current.

#### Scenario: A stale bookmark
- **WHEN** the operator opens the page of an event whose folder was renamed since
- **THEN** the page says that event was not found, and offers a link back to the list

#### Scenario: An unreadable event reads the same as in the list
- **WHEN** the operator opens the page of `2024-02-30 - Omöjligt datum`, whose folder date is impossible
- **THEN** the page shows the same failure words and detail that event's "Needs attention" row shows in the
  list

#### Scenario: The database is down
- **WHEN** the service answers the event read with its database-failure problem body
- **THEN** the page says the service cannot reach its database, and shows no event content

#### Scenario: A refresh fails after a successful load
- **WHEN** an event's page was shown and a refresh then fails
- **THEN** the earlier content is no longer shown, and the failure is

### Requirement: Every page shares one header and follows the operator's color scheme

Every page SHALL show the same header. The header SHALL contain:

- the product's mark and name
- a link to the event list, marked as the current page while the list is shown
- a control for choosing the color scheme: System, Light or Dark

The header SHALL stay visible while the page scrolls.

The screens SHALL render in a light and a dark color scheme drawn from one set of design tokens. Tokens SHALL
exist for colors, spacing, radii, type and motion. The screens SHALL follow the operating system's color
preference until the operator chooses Light or Dark. The choice SHALL persist in that browser across reloads
and new tabs, and SHALL apply before the first paint, so a reload never flashes the other scheme. Choosing
System SHALL return to following the operating system.

When the browser refuses storage, the screens SHALL follow the operating system and render without error.
The control SHALL still switch the scheme for the current page.

#### Scenario: The operating system's preference is followed by default
- **WHEN** the operator's system prefers dark and no choice was made in this browser
- **THEN** the event list for the dev library renders in the dark scheme, and the control shows System

#### Scenario: A chosen scheme survives a reload
- **WHEN** the operator's system prefers dark, the operator chooses Light on the page of
  `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, and then reloads
- **THEN** the page renders in the light scheme from the first paint, and the control shows Light

#### Scenario: System returns to the operating system's preference
- **WHEN** the operator chose Dark earlier and now chooses System on a system that prefers light
- **THEN** the page renders in the light scheme

#### Scenario: Storage is blocked
- **WHEN** the browser throws on every storage access and the operator opens the event list
- **THEN** the list renders in the operating system's scheme with no error shown, and choosing Dark switches
  the current page to the dark scheme

#### Scenario: The header marks where the operator is
- **WHEN** the event list is shown
- **THEN** the header's Events link is marked as the current page, and it is not marked on the page of
  `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`

### Requirement: State is never shown by color alone

Every render verdict, job status, clip status and event failure kind a screen shows SHALL be shown as its
words, paired with an icon, and never as a color alone. The same holds for warnings and failure messages:
each shows its words and an icon. Tones SHALL be consistent across screens: the same status has the same
tone and icon on every page.

In both color schemes, text SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast: at least 4.5:1 for normal-size text, and at
least 3:1 for large text and for the focus indicator against its background. This includes the words inside
status labels and secondary ("muted") text. As in WCAG, the label of a control that is currently
unavailable (such as Refresh while it reads) is exempt.

#### Scenario: Verdicts read in grayscale
- **WHEN** the event list for the dev library is viewed with all color removed
- **THEN** `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` still reads "Needs render" with its reasons, and
  `2023-06-23 - Midsommar - Dalarna` still reads "Up to date"

#### Scenario: Status labels meet contrast in both schemes
- **WHEN** the contrast of every status label's text on its own background, and of the scan time's muted
  text on the page background, is measured in the light and in the dark scheme
- **THEN** every ratio is at least 4.5:1

#### Scenario: A failed job is marked by words and icon
- **WHEN** the list shows `2024-10-05 - Trasig`, whose latest job failed
- **THEN** its job status reads "Failed" beside an icon, and not only in a red color

### Requirement: The screens are operable by keyboard

Every interactive control SHALL be reachable with the keyboard, in a logical order, and SHALL show a visible
focus indicator in both color schemes when focused from the keyboard.

Each page SHALL have exactly one level-one heading, naming the page. Each section SHALL have a level-two
heading: a year group, "Needs attention", or a chapter.

The first control in the tab order SHALL be a skip control. It SHALL move focus to the page's level-one
heading and SHALL NOT change the page's address.

After the operator moves between pages (opening an event, Back, Forward, or the header's Events link), focus
SHALL be on the new page's level-one heading. A control that becomes busy (such as Refresh while reading)
SHALL keep keyboard focus, and SHALL NOT be removed from the tab order. A focused control SHALL NOT be hidden
behind anything that stays in place while the page scrolls, such as the header.

#### Scenario: The skip control reaches the content without navigating
- **WHEN** the operator loads the event list and presses Tab once, then Enter
- **THEN** the skip control is visible while focused, focus moves to the "Events" heading, and the address
  is unchanged

#### Scenario: Opening an event moves focus to its heading
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` from the list with the keyboard
- **THEN** focus is on that page's level-one heading, and the page has a level-two heading for `Main` and
  one for `Kvällen`

#### Scenario: Refresh keeps focus
- **WHEN** the operator presses Enter on the list's Refresh button
- **THEN** the list is read again, and focus stays on the Refresh button throughout

#### Scenario: Focus is visible in the dark scheme
- **WHEN** the operator tabs to an event link in the dark scheme
- **THEN** a focus indicator is visible around it

#### Scenario: The sticky header never covers focus
- **WHEN** the operator tabs down through every event link of the dev library's list
- **THEN** each focused link is fully visible below the header and below its year's heading

### Requirement: The screens respect reduced motion

When the operating system asks for reduced motion, the screens SHALL NOT animate. That means no transitions,
no shimmering placeholders, no spinning indicators, and no enter animations. When it does not ask, motion
SHALL be limited to short feedback on hover, focus, loading and appearing elements, and no information SHALL
depend on seeing an animation.

#### Scenario: Placeholders stand still under reduced motion
- **WHEN** the operator's system asks for reduced motion and the event list is being read
- **THEN** the placeholder rows are shown without any animation

### Requirement: The screens fit a phone-width window

In a window 390 CSS pixels wide, no page SHALL scroll horizontally. Every fact about an event, a clip or a
failure that a page shows in a wide window SHALL still be shown in the narrow one, rearranged and never
dropped. Long names and details SHALL wrap rather than overflow.

#### Scenario: The list at phone width
- **WHEN** the operator opens the dev library's event list in a window 390 pixels wide
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally, and each event still shows its date, title, location, clip
  counts, verdict with reasons, and latest job

#### Scenario: An event page at phone width
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` in a window 390 pixels wide
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally, and every clip still shows its position, file name,
  status, size and modification time

#### Scenario: A failure detail wraps
- **WHEN** the operator opens the list at 390 pixels wide, and it shows `2024-02-30 - Omöjligt datum` under
  "Needs attention"
- **THEN** its folder name, failure words and detail wrap within the window

### Requirement: A read in progress is shown as a placeholder and announced

While a screen reads from the service, it SHALL show placeholder rows shaped like its content in place of the
content. It SHALL also show a status message naming the read ("Scanning events…" on the list, "Reading
event…" on an event page), which assistive technology announces. Placeholders SHALL carry no event data, and
SHALL NOT show an earlier state of the screen as current.

#### Scenario: A slow list read
- **WHEN** the events list response takes two seconds
- **THEN** during those seconds the list shows placeholder rows and the announced message "Scanning events…",
  and no event from an earlier read

#### Scenario: A slow event read
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov` and its read takes two seconds
- **THEN** during those seconds the page shows its heading, placeholder rows and the announced message
  "Reading event…"

### Requirement: Reading a screen never changes state

Opening, refreshing, returning to, or moving between screens SHALL NOT write any file, enqueue or cancel any
job, or change any state the service holds. Such state SHALL change only through an explicit operator action
on a control that names what it does. The theme choice is a preference kept in the browser, not service
state.

The screens SHALL NOT re-read on a timer. A server push channel the client subscribes to is not polling.

#### Scenario: Browsing the dev library changes nothing
- **WHEN** the operator opens the list, refreshes it, switches it to Needs render, opens
  `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, refreshes that page, and goes back
- **THEN** every request the client made was a read, no file under the library changed, and the jobs the
  service lists are the same as before

#### Scenario: An idle screen makes no requests
- **WHEN** the event list is shown, no job runs, and the operator does nothing for a minute
- **THEN** the client makes no HTTP request during that minute

### Requirement: The event page reorders clips within a chapter

An event's page SHALL offer an **Edit** mode on the page itself. Entering or leaving it SHALL NOT change the
page's address. Entering Edit mode SHALL read the event's editorial document from the service. When that read
fails, the page SHALL say why, using the same words it uses for a failed event read, and SHALL offer no
editing. Entering Edit mode SHALL keep keyboard focus on the control that entered it, and leaving Edit mode,
by any path, SHALL move keyboard focus to the page's level-one heading.

While in Edit mode, the editor's chapter lists and metadata fields SHALL take the place of the chapter tables,
the facts and the description. Each chapter keeps its level-two heading, and each clip row keeps the facts
the table shows: its position, file name, status in words, size and modification time, with absent facts
shown as absent. The event's verdict and latest job stay shown. Leaving Edit mode, by any path, SHALL read
the event again and show the tables. Only the operator's own actions SHALL end Edit mode or change what it
holds: a read of the event that the page would start by itself while Edit mode is open SHALL NOT discard
the edits.

In Edit mode, each chapter SHALL list its clips in the order the page shows them. The operator SHALL be able
to move a clip to any other position **within its own chapter** in each of three ways:

- by dragging the clip's handle with a mouse, pen or touch. A drag SHALL start only from the handle, and a
  tap or click on the handle SHALL NOT start one. A scroll gesture that starts anywhere else on the page
  SHALL scroll it.
- from the keyboard, on the clip's handle: one key lifts the clip, the arrow keys move it, one key drops it,
  and Escape cancels, leaving the order as it was
- with a **Move up** and a **Move down** control on every movable row. After such a move, keyboard focus SHALL
  stay on the moved clip's row.

Every keyboard or control move, and every drop or cancel, SHALL be announced to assistive technology with the
clip's file name and its position out of the number of clips the chapter plays (its ignored clips are not
counted). A clip SHALL NOT be movable into another
chapter: a dragged clip stops at its own chapter's edge. The page SHALL count as moved the fewest clips whose
moves explain the new order, so that moving one clip from position 1 to position 5 moves one clip, not five.
Each clip counted as moved SHALL show its position from when Edit mode opened.

Clips the event ignores are not part of the play order. Each chapter SHALL list them after its other clips,
marked as ignored, and they SHALL NOT be movable or counted in the chapter's positions. A missing clip SHALL
stay listed and movable, and SHALL never be dropped from its chapter. A NEW clip SHALL be movable like any
other.

#### Scenario: Dragging a clip to the front
- **WHEN** in Edit mode on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator drags `s1710004.mp4` above
  `s1710001.mp4`
- **THEN** the chapter lists `s1710004.mp4`, `s1710001.mp4`, `s1710002.mp4`, `s1710003.mp4`, and
  `s1710004.mp4` shows that it was at position 4

#### Scenario: Reordering from the keyboard
- **WHEN** on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, the operator focuses the handle of `Kvällen/s1710002.mp4`,
  lifts it, presses Down once, and drops it
- **THEN** `Kvällen` lists `s1710003.mp4`, `s1710002.mp4`, `s1710004.mp4`, and a screen reader hears that
  `s1710002.mp4` moved to position 2 of 3

#### Scenario: Escape cancels a keyboard move
- **WHEN** on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator lifts `s1710001.mp4` from the keyboard, moves
  it two places, and presses Escape
- **THEN** the clip is back at position 1, the order is unchanged, and the cancel is announced

#### Scenario: The move controls keep focus on the moved clip
- **WHEN** on `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`, the operator activates **Move down** on `s1710002.mp4`
- **THEN** `s1710002.mp4` is at position 2, keyboard focus is still on its row, and its move is announced

#### Scenario: A clip cannot leave its chapter
- **WHEN** on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, the operator drags `Kvällen/s1710003.mp4` upward toward the
  `Main` chapter, past the top of `Kvällen`, and releases it
- **THEN** the dragged row stopped at the top edge of `Kvällen`, the clip is now first in `Kvällen`, and
  `Main` is unchanged

#### Scenario: An ignored clip is listed but cannot move
- **WHEN** Edit mode opens on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`
- **THEN** `Main` lists `s1710001.mp4` and then `s1710004.mp4`, marked as ignored, and `s1710004.mp4` has no
  handle and no move controls

#### Scenario: A missing clip keeps its place
- **WHEN** Edit mode opens on `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`, whose `reel.yaml` lists the missing `borttagen.mp4`
  last
- **THEN** `borttagen.mp4` is listed at position 3, marked as missing, and can be moved like the others

#### Scenario: A large chapter is fully editable
- **WHEN** an event holds 400 clips in one chapter
- **THEN** all 400 are listed in Edit mode, and any of them can be moved to any position in the chapter

#### Scenario: The editorial document cannot be read
- **WHEN** the operator enters Edit mode on an event whose `reel.yaml` became unparseable after the page was
  read
- **THEN** the page shows the unparseable-document failure in words, with the service's detail, and offers
  no editing

### Requirement: The event page edits the event's metadata

In Edit mode the page SHALL offer the event's title, date, location and description as editable fields. The
fields SHALL be filled with what the event's `reel.yaml` itself says, not with the values the page resolves
from the folder name. A field that `reel.yaml` leaves unset SHALL be shown empty. When the page shows a value
for that field derived from the folder name, that value SHALL be shown next to the field as inherited from
the folder name. A field the operator empties, after `reel.yaml` had set it, SHALL say that it will inherit
from the folder name once saved, and SHALL NOT present the value `reel.yaml` set as the folder name's.

A field left empty, or holding only whitespace, SHALL be saved as unset, so that it inherits again. The date
SHALL be entered as a calendar date. A date the operator has not finished entering SHALL NOT be saved, as
unset or otherwise: the page SHALL say that the date is incomplete and SHALL NOT offer to save until it is
completed or cleared. Beyond that, the page SHALL leave the judgement of whether a date or title is usable,
for example a date in the future, to the service. When the service refuses one, the page SHALL show the
service's explanation at the date and title fields.

#### Scenario: Authored values fill the form
- **WHEN** Edit mode opens on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, whose `reel.yaml` sets the title
  `Grillkväll med grannarna` and the date `2024-06-27`
- **THEN** the title field holds `Grillkväll med grannarna`, the date field holds `2024-06-27`, and the
  location and description fields are empty

#### Scenario: Inherited values are shown as inherited
- **WHEN** Edit mode opens on `2024-07-14 - kalas`, which has no `reel.yaml`
- **THEN** every field is empty, and the title and date fields show `Kalas` and `2024-07-14` as inherited from
  the folder name

#### Scenario: Clearing a field makes it inherit
- **WHEN** the operator empties the title field of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`
- **THEN** the field says it will inherit from the folder name, without naming `Grillkväll med grannarna` as
  the folder name's title; and after saving, `reel.yaml` sets no title and the page shows the folder name's
  title, `Grillning med Grannar`

#### Scenario: An unfinished date is never saved as unset
- **WHEN** the operator clears only the day of the date of `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna`, leaving the
  date incomplete
- **THEN** the page says the date is incomplete and offers no Save, and `reel.yaml` still sets `2024-06-21`

#### Scenario: A future date is refused at the field
- **WHEN** the operator sets the date of `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna` to a day after today and saves
- **THEN** the date and title fields show the service's explanation that the date is in the future, and
  `reel.yaml` is unchanged

### Requirement: Saving an edit writes only what the operator changed

Edits SHALL be saved only when the operator asks. While Edit mode holds changes that differ from what it
read, the page SHALL keep visible:

- which metadata fields changed
- how many clips moved, counted as the reorder requirement counts them
- when saving a new order would add NEW clips to `reel.yaml`, how many
- a **Reset** control, which restores what was read
- a **Save** control

An edit that is undone, such as a clip moved and moved back, SHALL leave no change to save.

Saving SHALL write the editorial document exactly as Edit mode read it, with only the operator's edits
applied:

- **Edited metadata fields** take their new values.
- **A chapter whose order changed** is written in the order shown, with its ignored clips left out and its
  missing and NEW clips kept in place.
- **Everything else** is written exactly as read: every other chapter, every per-clip property, the ignored
  clips and the look.

When `reel.yaml` names no chapters, either because the event has no `reel.yaml` or because its `reel.yaml`
sets none, one exception applies. A save that changes an order SHALL write every chapter as shown, each
without its ignored clips, and a save that changes only metadata SHALL still write no chapters.

The save SHALL be conditional on the editorial state being the one Edit mode read, so that a change made
elsewhere in the meantime is detected rather than overwritten. While a save is in flight, the page SHALL
NOT start another save or accept further edits. The control that started it (Save, Retry, or the overwrite
after a conflict) SHALL show that it is busy and SHALL keep keyboard focus until the service answers.

When a save succeeds, the page SHALL:

- confirm it
- leave Edit mode
- read the event again, which then shows the event as needing a render
- read the list again the next time the list is shown

A save SHALL NOT enqueue a render. Entering Edit mode also has a guard. When the event's chapters as the page
shows them no longer agree with the editorial document it just read (the event changed on disk in between),
Edit mode SHALL say so and offer to read the event again, and SHALL NOT offer to save.

#### Scenario: Reordering one chapter leaves the rest untouched
- **WHEN** on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, the operator moves `Kvällen/s1710004.mp4` (NEW) to the
  front of `Kvällen` and saves
- **THEN** `reel.yaml` lists `Kvällen` as `Kvällen/s1710004.mp4`, `Kvällen/s1710002.mp4` and
  `Kvällen/s1710003.mp4`, lists `Main` as `s1710001.mp4` alone, and still ignores `s1710004.mp4`

#### Scenario: The editor says a reorder adopts NEW clips
- **WHEN** on `2024-08-02 - Badutflykt - Varberg`, whose `reel.yaml` lists two of its three clips, the
  operator moves `s1710001.mp4` below `s1710003.mp4`
- **THEN** before saving, the page says that saving adds 1 new clip to `reel.yaml`, and after saving,
  `reel.yaml` lists `s1710003.mp4`, `s1710001.mp4` and `s1710004.mp4`

#### Scenario: A missing clip survives a reorder
- **WHEN** on `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`, the operator swaps `s1710002.mp4` and `s1710004.mp4` and saves
- **THEN** `reel.yaml` lists `s1710004.mp4`, `s1710002.mp4` and `borttagen.mp4`, and `borttagen.mp4` keeps
  its end-of-line comment

#### Scenario: A metadata edit leaves the clip order alone
- **WHEN** the operator changes only the location of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` to `Hönö` and saves
- **THEN** `reel.yaml` gains the location, and its chapters are unchanged

#### Scenario: A document without chapters stays without chapters
- **WHEN** the operator changes only the title of `2024/Blandat`, whose `reel.yaml` names no chapters, and
  saves
- **THEN** the saved `reel.yaml` has the new title and still names no chapters

#### Scenario: A first reorder writes every chapter
- **WHEN** an event with clips in two chapter folders has no `reel.yaml`, and the operator reorders one
  chapter and saves
- **THEN** the new `reel.yaml` lists both chapters with every clip: the reordered one in its new order, the
  other in the order the page showed

#### Scenario: An undone move leaves nothing to save
- **WHEN** on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator moves `s1710002.mp4` down and then back up
- **THEN** the page shows no unsaved changes, and offers no Save

#### Scenario: Save keeps focus while it is in flight
- **WHEN** on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, with a reorder pending, the operator presses Enter on
  Save and the service has not answered yet
- **THEN** Save shows that it is busy, keyboard focus is still on Save, a second Enter sends no second save,
  and the clip lists and fields accept no edits

#### Scenario: A saved edit makes the event need a render
- **WHEN** the operator saves a new title for `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna`
- **THEN** the page confirms the save, leaves Edit mode, and shows the new title and that the event needs a
  render because of the edit. No job was enqueued, and on returning to the list, the list is read again and
  shows the new title.

#### Scenario: The event changed on disk before editing
- **WHEN** a clip is added to `reel.yaml` of `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov` by hand after its page was read, and
  the operator then enters Edit mode
- **THEN** Edit mode says the event changed since the page was read, offers to read it again, and offers no
  Save

### Requirement: A failed save keeps the operator's edits and says why

When a save fails, the page SHALL keep every unsaved edit and SHALL say why. It SHALL take the distinction
from the service's answer, not from its prose:

- **The event changed since Edit mode read it** (a conflict). The page SHALL say so and offer two choices:
  - "Reload latest", which discards the edits and reads the current state
  - "Overwrite with mine", which asks for confirmation, with cancelling as the choice focused first, and
    then saves the edits over the other change
- **The service refuses the date or title as unusable.** The explanation SHALL be shown at those fields.
  Any other refused state SHALL be shown with the service's detail.
- **The event no longer exists.** The page SHALL say so and offer the way back to the list.
- **The service could not read or save the event's files.** The page SHALL show the failure kind in the same
  words the list uses when the answer carries one, and the service's detail, and SHALL offer to retry.
- **The service does not answer.** The page SHALL say the service is not reachable and SHALL offer to retry.

#### Scenario: A conflicting edit made elsewhere
- **WHEN** the operator is editing `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, its `reel.yaml` title is changed by
  hand, and the operator then saves
- **THEN** the page says the event changed since it was read, the operator's edits are still shown, and
  `reel.yaml` still holds the hand-made title

#### Scenario: Overwriting after a conflict
- **WHEN** after that conflict the operator chooses "Overwrite with mine" and confirms
- **THEN** the operator's version is saved, and the page confirms the save

#### Scenario: Reloading after a conflict
- **WHEN** after that conflict the operator chooses "Reload latest"
- **THEN** the edits are discarded, and the page shows the hand-made title

#### Scenario: A read-only event folder
- **WHEN** the operator saves a reorder of `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov` while its folder cannot be written
- **THEN** the page says the save was refused, shows the service's detail naming the operating-system error,
  keeps the reorder, and offers Retry. Once the folder is writable again, Retry saves it.

#### Scenario: The service is down
- **WHEN** the operator saves a reorder of `2024-08-02 - Badutflykt - Varberg` while the service is not
  answering
- **THEN** the page says the service is not reachable, keeps the edits, and offers Retry

### Requirement: Unsaved edits are never discarded silently

While Edit mode holds unsaved changes, every way of leaving them SHALL ask first:

- **Closing or reloading the browser tab** SHALL trigger the browser's own leave-page confirmation.
- **Back, Forward, following a link, or typing another address in the app** SHALL keep the page and ask
  "Discard unsaved changes?". Its default choice keeps editing: choosing it, or pressing Escape, SHALL
  leave the page, its address and its edits as they were. Discarding SHALL continue to where the operator
  was going.
- **Refreshing the event and leaving Edit mode** SHALL ask the same question.

Reset, and "Reload latest" after a conflict, are themselves named discards and SHALL NOT ask. With no unsaved
changes, nothing SHALL ask.

#### Scenario: Back asks before discarding
- **WHEN** the operator has reordered clips on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` and presses the browser's
  Back
- **THEN** the event page stays, with its address and the reorder, and asks "Discard unsaved changes?"

#### Scenario: Keeping the edits
- **WHEN** the operator answers that question with Escape
- **THEN** the event page, its address and its edits are unchanged

#### Scenario: Discarding the edits
- **WHEN** the operator answers that question with Discard
- **THEN** the list is shown, and `reel.yaml` is unchanged

#### Scenario: Reloading the tab
- **WHEN** the operator reloads the browser tab with unsaved edits on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`
- **THEN** the browser asks for confirmation before leaving the page

#### Scenario: Refresh asks too
- **WHEN** the operator presses Refresh on the page of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` with unsaved edits
- **THEN** the page asks "Discard unsaved changes?" before reading the event again

#### Scenario: Nothing to lose, nothing asked
- **WHEN** the operator enters Edit mode on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, changes nothing, and presses
  Back
- **THEN** the list is shown without a question

### Requirement: Events that need attention open a page that can fix their metadata

Every row of the list's "Needs attention" group SHALL link to its event's page. When the page's read of an
event fails with the unusable-metadata kind (no real date, no title, or a date in the future), the page SHALL
show that failure, as it does today, together with the metadata form. The form SHALL be filled from the
event's `reel.yaml`, or left empty when there is none. It SHALL save under the same rules as Edit mode, and
SHALL write no chapters the event's `reel.yaml` does not already hold. After a successful save, the page SHALL
read the event again and show it. The list SHALL be read again the next time it is shown. For every other
failure kind, the page SHALL show the failure only, since its detail states the fix.

#### Scenario: The impossible date is fixed from the page
- **WHEN** the operator follows the "Needs attention" row of `2024-02-30 - Omöjligt datum`, enters the date
  `2024-02-29` in the form shown with the failure, and saves
- **THEN** the page reads the event again and shows it with its clip and its title `Omöjligt Datum`. On
  returning, the list shows it among the 2024 events, and it is no longer under "Needs attention".

#### Scenario: A refused fix keeps the failure
- **WHEN** on the same page the operator enters a date after today and saves
- **THEN** the date and title fields show the service's explanation, and the failure is still shown

#### Scenario: Other failures offer no form
- **WHEN** an event's `reel.yaml` cannot be parsed, and the operator follows its "Needs attention" row
- **THEN** the page shows the unparseable-document failure and its detail, and no form
