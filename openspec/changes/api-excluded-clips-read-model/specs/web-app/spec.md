## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A clip that reel.yaml excludes is marked as excluded

A clip that `reel.yaml` excludes (`clips.<identity>.exclude: true`) is listed in its chapter and kept in the
document, but a render drops it from the movie. The event page and Edit mode SHALL say so for every such clip,
whatever its status, from the clip's `excluded` flag in the event read:

- Its row SHALL carry an **Excluded** status label, in words and with an icon of its own, never by color alone.
  The label SHALL be a status label like New and Missing, with the fill and edge those have.
- An excluded clip on disk SHALL show the Excluded label in place of the quiet word "Included", since the
  clip is not included in the movie. An excluded missing clip SHALL show both its Missing label and the
  Excluded label.
- The clip keeps its place and its position number in its chapter's list, as `reel.yaml` has it, on the
  event page and in Edit mode alike, so that the two screens number the same rows. Moving, dragging and
  removing a missing clip work on it as on any other.
- The clip counts of the facts line SHALL give the number of excluded clips ("1 excluded") when it is
  non-zero. The excluded clips stay among the clips counted, as the new and missing ones do.
- Its row SHALL show no cuts and offer none ("Edit mode lists, adds and removes a clip's cuts").

The client SHALL take the mark from the event read's `excluded` flag. It MUST NOT infer exclusion from the
editorial document read for Edit mode, so that both screens show the one fact the service reports.

#### Scenario: An excluded clip is marked on the event page
- **WHEN** the operator opens an event whose `reel.yaml` lists `s1710001.mp4`, `s1710002.mp4` and
  `s1710003.mp4` in one chapter and excludes `s1710002.mp4`
- **THEN** the chapter's table lists the three clips at positions 1, 2 and 3, `s1710002.mp4` with the
  Excluded label and the other two as "Included", and the facts line reads "3 clips" with "1 excluded"

#### Scenario: An excluded missing clip shows both labels
- **WHEN** `reel.yaml` lists `borta.mp4`, excludes it, and the file is not on disk
- **THEN** its row shows the Missing label and the Excluded label, no size and no time

#### Scenario: Edit mode marks the same clip
- **WHEN** the operator enters Edit mode on that event
- **THEN** `s1710002.mp4` is listed at position 2 with the Excluded label, and the Included word is not shown
  for it

#### Scenario: The mark is not by color alone
- **WHEN** the Excluded label is shown in light and in dark mode
- **THEN** it reads "Excluded" in words and has an icon, and its fill and edge differ from the Included word's

### Requirement: An event's page schedules its render, held back only by clips a render needs

An event's page SHALL offer, as explicit controls that name what they do:

- a **Render** control when the event needs a render, has no queued or running job, lists no missing clip
  that blocks a render, and the page is not in Edit mode
- when the event is up to date, has no queued or running job, lists no missing clip that blocks a render,
  and the page is not in Edit mode: its up-to-date state plus a secondary **Render anyway** control, which asks
  for confirmation before it forces a render

While the page is in Edit mode, it SHALL offer neither control and SHALL instead say that the edits must be
saved, or Edit mode left, before rendering: a render reads the saved `reel.yaml`, not the unsaved edits. A
queued or running job's progress and its Cancel control stay offered in Edit mode.

A missing clip *blocks* a render when `reel.yaml` names it and does not exclude it, because a render fails
on a missing clip that it plays. A missing clip that `reel.yaml` excludes does not block one: a render skips
it. The page SHALL take which missing clips block from the event read's `blocking_missing`, never from the
list of all missing clips. While the event lists a blocking missing clip, and the page is not in Edit mode,
the page SHALL offer neither control. It SHALL instead say, in words, that the clip is missing from disk and
that it must be restored, or removed in Edit mode, before rendering. For one blocking clip the words SHALL
name it; for several they SHALL give their number, and an excluded missing clip SHALL NOT be counted in
them. A queued or running job's progress and its Cancel control stay offered.

Pressing a control SHALL send one enqueue request, and SHALL NOT send another while that one is
unanswered. Until the answer arrives, the pressed control SHALL stay in place, keep keyboard focus, be
marked busy, and ignore further presses. The page SHALL handle every answer the service publishes:

- **job created:** the page follows the new job
- **up to date, not enqueued:** the page says there is nothing to render, and offers Render anyway
- **a job is already active for the event:** the page follows that job, not an error
- **another event claims the same movie file:** the page names each other event, with a link to its page,
  and says the fix: a distinct title or location in `reel.yaml`
- **unknown event:** the page says the event no longer exists
- **the project could not be scanned** (so the service could not check for another claimant): the page
  says so, with the service's detail, and that nothing was queued
- **the service cannot reach its database** (a 503 whose problem body names the database as the failing
  dependency): the page says the render was not queued because the service can't reach its database, with
  the service's detail
- **any other answer, or none:** the page says the render was not queued, with the status it received or
  that the service is not reachable. It MUST NOT name a cause the answer does not carry; a server error
  without a problem body is not reported as a database failure.

The page MUST tell these outcomes apart by the published status, conflict kind and failing dependency, not by
the problem's prose. Only an event page that shows the event's render state offers these controls; a page whose read
failed offers none.

Render anyway's confirmation asks about an event that is up to date and has no queued or running job. While
it is open and no enqueue request is in flight, if the page would no longer offer Render anyway (a queued or
running job for the event reaches the page, the event no longer reads as up to date, or a missing clip that blocks
a render now holds it back), the dialog SHALL close by itself and send nothing. Whenever a
dialog of the page's render region closes after the control that opened it is gone (Render anyway, once the
job it started shows, or any dialog that closed by itself), keyboard focus SHALL move to the page's job
status, whose words say how the job stands. Focus SHALL NOT fall to the document's body.

#### Scenario: A stale event is rendered
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, which needs a render, and presses Render
- **THEN** one job is enqueued for it, and the page shows that job as queued

#### Scenario: An up-to-date event is rendered only on purpose
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna`, which is up to date
- **THEN** the page shows it as up to date and offers Render anyway, and a render is enqueued only after
  the operator confirms it

#### Scenario: The event became fresh since the page was read
- **WHEN** the page of `2024/Blandat` showed it as needing a render, a job queued elsewhere then rendered
  it while the page had no live connection, and the operator presses Render
- **THEN** no job is enqueued, the page says there is nothing to render and offers Render anyway, and it
  re-reads to show the event as up to date

#### Scenario: A job is already active
- **WHEN** a job for `2024-08-02 - Badutflykt - Varberg` was enqueued elsewhere after the page was read,
  before the page learned of it, and the operator presses Render
- **THEN** the page shows that existing job's state, with no error and no second job

#### Scenario: Two events claim the same movie file
- **WHEN** the operator presses Render on `2024-07-14 - kalas`
- **THEN** no job is enqueued, and the page names `2024-07-14 - Kalas` as the other claimant, links to it,
  and says to give one of them a distinct title or location in `reel.yaml`

#### Scenario: A double click enqueues once
- **WHEN** the operator double-clicks Render on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`
- **THEN** one enqueue request is sent

#### Scenario: Render keeps focus while it waits
- **WHEN** the operator presses Enter on Render on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, and the service takes
  two seconds to answer
- **THEN** during those seconds focus stays on Render, which is marked busy, and pressing Enter again sends
  nothing

#### Scenario: Edit mode holds Render back
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, which needs a render, and enters Edit mode
- **THEN** the page offers no Render control and says to save or leave Edit mode to render, and once Edit
  mode ends, Render is offered again

#### Scenario: An unreadable event offers no Render
- **WHEN** the operator opens the page of `2024-02-30 - Omöjligt datum`, whose read fails
- **THEN** the page shows the failure and offers no Render control

#### Scenario: A missing clip holds Render back
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`, which needs a render and whose `reel.yaml` lists the
  missing `borttagen.mp4`
- **THEN** the page offers neither Render nor Render anyway, and says that `borttagen.mp4` is missing from
  disk and to restore it, or remove it in Edit mode

#### Scenario: Several missing clips are counted
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-09-02 - Två saknade`, whose `reel.yaml` lists two missing clips
- **THEN** the page offers no Render, and says that 2 clips are missing from disk and to restore them, or
  remove them in Edit mode

#### Scenario: An excluded missing clip does not hold Render back
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-09-03 - Utesluten`, which needs a render and whose `reel.yaml` lists the
  missing `borta.mp4` and excludes it
- **THEN** the page offers Render, and its warning above the chapters names `borta.mp4` as missing and
  excluded

#### Scenario: Only the missing clip a render needs is named
- **WHEN** the operator opens an event that lists the missing `borta.mp4`, which `reel.yaml` excludes, and
  the missing `borttagen.mp4`, which it does not
- **THEN** the page offers neither Render nor Render anyway, and says that `borttagen.mp4` is missing from
  disk and to restore it, or remove it in Edit mode, without naming or counting `borta.mp4`

#### Scenario: Edit mode's reason takes the place of the missing clip's
- **WHEN** the operator enters Edit mode on `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`
- **THEN** the page says to save or leave Edit mode to render, and once Edit mode ends with nothing saved, it
  says again that `borttagen.mp4` is missing from disk

#### Scenario: A job queued for such an event can still be cancelled
- **WHEN** a job for `2024-09-02 - Två saknade` was queued before its page was opened, and no worker is
  running
- **THEN** the page shows the job waiting for a worker, with its Cancel control, says that clips are missing
  from disk, and offers no Render

#### Scenario: Confirming Render anyway keeps the keyboard's place
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna`, which is up to date, presses Render anyway
  with the keyboard, and confirms it with the keyboard
- **THEN** one job is enqueued, the page shows it queued, keyboard focus is on the page's job status, and the
  next Tab reaches Cancel

#### Scenario: Render anyway's question closes when a render starts elsewhere
- **WHEN** the Render anyway dialog is open on `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna`, and a job for that event,
  queued by another client, reaches the page over the connection
- **THEN** the dialog closes by itself, the page sends no enqueue request, and it shows that job queued, with
  keyboard focus on its job status

#### Scenario: The database is down when Render is pressed
- **WHEN** the operator presses Render on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` and the service answers 503
  naming the database as the failing dependency
- **THEN** no job is shown, and the page says the render was not queued because the service can't reach its
  database, with the service's detail, and not that the project could not be scanned

#### Scenario: A server error without a problem body is not a database failure
- **WHEN** the operator presses Render on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` and the service answers 500
  with no problem body, or answers 503 without naming the database
- **THEN** the page says the render was not queued, with the status it received, and does not say that the
  service can't reach its database

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: The event list shows every event with its render state

The client's first screen SHALL list every event the events list response returns. Events SHALL be grouped
by the year of their date, groups newest year first, and events within a group newest date first. Events
with no date SHALL form their own group after every dated group. Each event SHALL show:

- its date
- its title, or the event's folder name when it has no title
- its location when it has one
- its clip count: the clips it lists that are not ignored, the new and missing ones among them, as the
  event's page counts them
- its ignored clip count, when it is non-zero
- its NEW and MISSING clip counts when either is non-zero
- whether it needs a render and, if so, every reason the verdict cites, in words
- its latest job's status, when it has one

When two or more events the list shows would read the same, because they have the same date, the same title
(or, for an event with no title, the same folder name in its place) and the same location, compared without
regard to letter case, each of them SHALL also show its folder's path under the project root, for example
`2024/2024-07-14 - Kalas`. No two events share that path, so rows that would otherwise read the same are
told apart, even when their folders have the same name in different parent folders.

The screen MUST NOT omit an event the response contains, invent a fact the response does not carry, or
present a missing fact (no date, no title, no job) as a value.

#### Scenario: A multi-year library is grouped newest first
- **WHEN** the list contains events dated in 2023 and 2024 and one event with no date
- **THEN** the 2024 group appears first, then 2023, then the undated group, and each dated group is ordered
  newest date first

#### Scenario: An untitled event is shown by its folder name
- **WHEN** an event has no title in its metadata
- **THEN** it is shown under its event folder's name, not as an empty row or "Untitled"

#### Scenario: A stale event names every reason
- **WHEN** the title of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` was changed after its last render, while its
  movie is still on disk under the old name, so its verdict cites the editorial change and the changed movie
  name
- **THEN** its row says it needs a render and names both reasons in words, "edited since last render" and
  "movie name changed", and does not say that the movie file is missing

#### Scenario: A movie deleted from disk is named missing
- **WHEN** the movie of `2024-06-21 - Midsommar - Dalarna` was deleted after its last render, and nothing
  else about the event changed
- **THEN** its row says it needs a render because the movie file is missing, and names no other reason

#### Scenario: NEW and MISSING clips are visible
- **WHEN** an event has one NEW clip, and another references one clip that is absent from disk
- **THEN** the first row shows one new clip and the second shows one missing clip

#### Scenario: Ignored clips are counted apart
- **WHEN** an event lists two clips and its folder holds a third that `reel.yaml` ignores
- **THEN** its row shows 2 clips and 1 ignored, the same two numbers its page shows, and not 3 clips

#### Scenario: The latest job's outcome is visible
- **WHEN** one event's latest job failed, another's is queued, and a third has no job
- **THEN** the first row shows the failure, the second shows that it is queued, and the third shows no job
  status at all

#### Scenario: Look-alike events are told apart
- **WHEN** the list shows `2024/2024-07-14 - Kalas` and `2024/2024-07-14 - kalas`, both titled "Kalas", dated
  2024-07-14 and with no location
- **THEN** the first row also shows `2024/2024-07-14 - Kalas`, and the second `2024/2024-07-14 - kalas`
- **AND** no other row of the dev library shows its folder's path beside its title

#### Scenario: Look-alike folders of the same name are told apart
- **WHEN** the list shows `2023/Blandat` and `2024/Blandat`, neither with a date, a title or a location
- **THEN** both rows read "Blandat" in the undated group, and the first also shows `2023/Blandat` and the
  second `2024/Blandat`

### Requirement: The event page shows the event's chapters and clips

An event's page SHALL show, from the event detail the service returns:

- the event's title, or its folder name when it has no title, with its date, location and description
  when present. When the heading shows a title that differs from the event's folder name, the page SHALL
  also show the folder name as secondary text, and SHALL give it to assistive technology as the heading's
  description, so that two events with the same title and date can be told apart.
- whether it needs a render, with every reason in words, or that it is up to date
- its latest job's status and time, when it has one
- counts of its clips, their total size, and its new, missing, excluded and ignored clips

The verdict and the latest job SHALL be shown together, in the one region that holds the page's render
controls, between the page's heading and its chapters. The clip counts SHALL be shown with the event's facts
under the heading, not between that region and the chapters.

Each chapter SHALL be shown as a table, in the order the service returns, with the default chapter's clips
under the label `Main` when the event also has named chapters. Each chapter SHALL first list the clips it
plays, in play order, each with its position in the chapter, numbered from 1. After them it SHALL list the
clips the event ignores, marked as ignored and with no position, because an ignored clip is not part of the
play order. A chapter's heading SHALL count the clips it plays, followed by the number of its ignored clips
when it has any. Every clip SHALL be listed with its name, its status in words, its size and its modification
time. A new, missing or ignored clip SHALL show its status as a status label. An included clip, the usual
case, SHALL show its status as quiet words with its icon, without a label's fill or edge, so that the other
statuses stand out. A clip the service reports without a size or time (a missing clip) SHALL show those as
absent, never as zero or a placeholder date. When `reel.yaml` lists clips that are missing from disk, the
page SHALL name them in a warning above the chapters, and SHALL mark each one that `reel.yaml` excludes as
excluded there. A clip that `reel.yaml` excludes SHALL be marked in its row, as "A clip that reel.yaml excludes
is marked as excluded" says.

A clip's name SHALL be its file name while every clip its chapter lists lies in the chapter's own folder
(the event folder, for the default chapter). A chapter that lists a clip from another folder SHALL name each
of its clips by its path inside the event folder, so that no two of its rows read alike.

The page SHALL read the event from the service when it opens and whenever the operator refreshes it. While
that read runs, the page SHALL show placeholders in the shape of what it will show: its heading, its facts
line, its render region, and clip rows laid out as the loaded rows are, each with its thumbnail box of the
loaded size. The heading SHALL show a placeholder, never a name that the read may replace, and SHALL still be
named by the event's folder name for assistive technology. The placeholders SHALL fit the window as the
loaded page does, without horizontal scroll from 320 CSS pixels up.

#### Scenario: Chapters and clips appear in play order
- **WHEN** an event has root clips and a `Kvällen` chapter
- **THEN** the page shows a `Main` table and a `Kvällen` table, each listing the clips it plays in the order
  the service returns, numbered from 1

#### Scenario: Every clip status is visible
- **WHEN** an event has an included clip, a NEW clip in a named chapter, a MISSING clip and an IGNORED clip
- **THEN** each is listed in its chapter with its status in words: the new, missing and ignored clips as
  status labels, and the included clip as the quiet word "Included" with its icon; and the counts line
  reports one new, one missing and one ignored clip

#### Scenario: An ignored clip has no position
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, whose `reel.yaml` ignores its root clip
  `s1710004.mp4`
- **THEN** `Main` lists `s1710001.mp4` at position 1 and then `s1710004.mp4`, marked as ignored and with no
  position, as Edit mode lists that chapter, and `Main`'s heading counts "1 clip" and "1 ignored"

#### Scenario: A new clip the service lists after an ignored one is numbered before it
- **WHEN** the root folder of `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` also holds a NEW clip `s1710009.mp4`, which
  the service lists after the ignored `s1710004.mp4` because it sorts after it on disk
- **THEN** `Main` lists `s1710001.mp4` at position 1, `s1710009.mp4` as new at position 2, and then
  `s1710004.mp4`, marked as ignored and with no position, in the order Edit mode lists them

#### Scenario: A clip from another folder is named by its path
- **WHEN** `reel.yaml` of `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` lists `Kvällen/s1710004.mp4` in its root
  chapter and ignores the root clip `s1710004.mp4`, as a hand edit leaves it (a render adopts no ignored
  clip, D-12)
- **THEN** `Main` names its rows `s1710001.mp4`, `Kvällen/s1710004.mp4` and `s1710004.mp4`, and `Kvällen`
  still names its rows `s1710002.mp4` and `s1710003.mp4`

#### Scenario: Two events with the same title are told apart
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-07-14 - Kalas` and then `2024-07-14 - kalas`, both titled `Kalas`
- **THEN** each page's heading reads `Kalas` with the date `2024-07-14`, and each page also shows its own
  folder name, `2024-07-14 - Kalas` on the first and `2024-07-14 - kalas` on the second, which assistive
  technology reads as the heading's description

#### Scenario: A folder name that is the title is not repeated
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024/Blandat`, whose title `Blandat` equals its folder name
- **THEN** the heading reads `Blandat`, and the page shows no separate folder name

#### Scenario: The render state reads as one region
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, which needs a render and whose latest
  job is rendered
- **THEN** "Needs render" with its reasons, the latest job "Rendered" with its time, and Render are shown
  in one region between the heading and the `Clips` table, and the line with its clip count and total size
  is shown under the heading

#### Scenario: The counts name the excluded clips
- **WHEN** the operator opens an event that lists three clips, one of which `reel.yaml` excludes
- **THEN** the facts line reads "3 clips" with the total size and "1 excluded", and the excluded clip is
  one of the three numbered rows

#### Scenario: A missing clip shows no invented facts
- **WHEN** `reel.yaml` lists `borttagen.mp4` and the file is not on disk
- **THEN** its row shows no size and no time, and a warning above the chapters names `borttagen.mp4`

#### Scenario: A stale event says why
- **WHEN** an event's `reel.yaml` was edited after its last render
- **THEN** the page shows that it needs a render, citing the edit in words

#### Scenario: A large event is fully listed
- **WHEN** an event holds 380 clips in one chapter
- **THEN** all 380 are listed, numbered 1 to 380

#### Scenario: A slow read keeps the page's shape
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` in a window 1280 pixels wide, and its read
  takes two seconds
- **THEN** during those seconds the heading shows a placeholder and no visible text, assistive technology
  names the heading `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, and each placeholder clip row is as tall as a
  loaded row; when the read answers, the heading reads `Grillkväll med grannarna` and the `Clips` table
  starts within 8 pixels of where the placeholder table started

### Requirement: The event list shows live job state and offers a render

Each event row the list shows with its render state SHALL show that event's job as the progress
requirement describes, and SHALL keep its height when the job's first percentage arrives. The job the
connection carries SHALL be matched to the row whose event id equals the
job's event directory. A row that needs a render, has no queued or running job, and lists no missing clip that
blocks a render (one that `reel.yaml` does not exclude) SHALL offer a compact **Render** control, whose accessible name names the event ("Render"
followed by the event's folder name), so that a list of Render controls is told apart by assistive
technology. At phone width, the row's job state keeps its "Last job" label whenever the row shows a job,
including one the connection reported after the list was read, and a row that shows no job has no such
label. The row's Render control, once
pressed, behaves as the page's: one request, focus kept, marked busy. Its answers are handled as on the
event's page, except as follows:

- when a job is created, the client tells assistive technology that the event's render was queued; when a
  job is already queued or running for the event, it tells it so. Neither answer raises a visible
  notification: the row shows the job at once, and a notification would cover the controls of the rows
  below it. The row then shows that job, and when the removed Render had keyboard focus, focus moves to
  the row's event link.
- when the event is up to date, a notification says so and links to the event's page. The list does not
  force a render.
- when another event claims the same movie file, an error notification names the other events and links to
  the pressed event's page.

A row's notifications, and what it tells assistive technology, SHALL name the pressed event as the
progress requirement's notifications do: by its title followed by its date, or by its folder name when it
has no title. The output-collision notification is the exception: it SHALL name the pressed event and the
other events by their folder names, since events that claim the same movie file share their date, title
and location.

A row that needs a render, has no queued or running job, but lists a missing clip that blocks a render SHALL
NOT offer Render, for the same reason as the event's page. In its place, the row SHALL say, in words with an
icon, that missing clips block its render. The row SHALL take which missing clips block from the list
response's `blocking_missing_count`. The row's count of missing clips, which includes an excluded one,
stays shown.

Error rows under "Needs attention" SHALL NOT offer Render.

#### Scenario: A row shows a queued job live
- **WHEN** a job is enqueued for `2024-08-02 - Badutflykt - Varberg` from its page, and the operator returns
  to the list
- **THEN** its row shows the job queued, and its progress once a worker runs it, with no refresh

#### Scenario: A row keeps its height when progress starts
- **WHEN** the list shows the job for `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` starting, and the first progress
  arrives
- **THEN** the row shows the percentage and keeps its height

#### Scenario: A stale row is rendered from the list
- **WHEN** the operator presses Render on the `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` row
- **THEN** a job is enqueued for that event, and the row shows it queued

#### Scenario: Fresh rows and error rows offer no Render
- **WHEN** the list shows `2023-06-23 - Midsommar - Dalarna`, which is up to date, and the `2024-02-30 -
  Omöjligt datum` error row
- **THEN** neither offers Render

#### Scenario: Live rows fit a phone-width window
- **WHEN** the list is shown 390 pixels wide, the `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` row shows a job
  enqueued after the list was read, and the `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` row offers Render
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally, the Två kapitel job is labelled "Last job", and the
  Grillning control is announced as "Render 2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar"

#### Scenario: A row with a missing clip offers no Render
- **WHEN** the list shows `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`, which needs a render and lists one missing clip
- **THEN** its row shows 1 missing clip and its verdict, offers no Render, and says that missing clips block
  its render

#### Scenario: A row whose only missing clip is excluded offers Render
- **WHEN** the list shows `2024-09-03 - Utesluten`, which needs a render and whose only missing clip is one
  that `reel.yaml` excludes
- **THEN** its row shows 1 missing clip and its verdict, offers Render, and does not say that missing clips
  block its render

#### Scenario: A missing-clip row fits a phone-width window
- **WHEN** the list is shown 390 pixels wide
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally, and the `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov` row still shows its missing
  clip count and the words that missing clips block its render

#### Scenario: A row's Render is confirmed in words
- **WHEN** the operator presses Enter on the Render control of the `2024-08-02 - Badutflykt - Varberg` row
- **THEN** one job is enqueued, the row shows it queued, keyboard focus is on the row's "Badutflykt" link,
  assistive technology is told once that the render of "Badutflykt", 2024-08-02, was queued, and no
  notification is shown over the list

#### Scenario: A collision notification names the folders
- **WHEN** the operator presses Render on the `2024-07-14 - kalas` row
- **THEN** no job is enqueued, and an error notification names `2024-07-14 - kalas` and `2024-07-14 - Kalas`
  by their folder names, with a link to the `2024-07-14 - kalas` page

### Requirement: Edit mode lists, adds and removes a clip's cuts

A clip's cuts are the spans of it that the movie leaves out. Each has a start and an end, in seconds from the
clip's start, and may have a reason. In Edit mode, every included or new clip that `reel.yaml` does not exclude (a clip on disk that a chapter
lists, or will list once the edits are saved) SHALL offer a **Cuts** control. The control SHALL say how many
cuts the clip has and, when it has any, how much time they cut out. Pressing it SHALL show or hide a panel
under the clip's row and SHALL leave keyboard focus on the control. The control SHALL say to assistive
technology whether the panel is shown, and SHALL name the clip as its row names it. In the keyboard order, the
Cuts control SHALL come after the row's other controls, and the panel's controls straight after it.

The panel SHALL list the clip's cuts in their order, each with its number in the list, its start and end, its
length and its reason in words. A clip without cuts SHALL say that the whole clip plays. A missing clip that
`reel.yaml` does not exclude SHALL show, in its row, how many cuts it has, and SHALL offer no Cuts control: its file is not on disk to cut, and
removing it from `reel.yaml` takes its cuts with it. Once the operator removes it, its row SHALL NOT show its
cuts any more, since the save drops them. An ignored clip SHALL have no cuts and no Cuts control.
An excluded clip is not in the movie, so its cuts do not apply: its row SHALL show no cuts and SHALL offer no
Cuts control, whether the clip is on disk or missing. Its cuts stay in `reel.yaml`, and a save SHALL write
them back unchanged.

**Times.** A cut's times are places in the clip, not moments in a day, so the format for moments ("Times are
written one way on every screen") does not apply to them. The page SHALL write a time as minutes and seconds
(`1:02.35`), with hours in front from one hour on (`1:01:15.5`). It SHALL write up to three decimals and no
trailing zero. It SHALL write a length under a minute in seconds (`1.5 s`), and from a minute on as a time. The time a clip's cuts cut out SHALL count, once,
every span that one or more of its cuts covers, as the render does.

**Adding a cut.** The panel SHALL take a start and an end, typed, and add the cut on request. Spaces around a
time SHALL be ignored. A time SHALL be accepted in each of these forms, with an optional decimal part of one
to three digits after `.` or `,`:

- seconds (`75.5`)
- minutes and seconds, the seconds as two digits below 60 (`1:15.5`)
- hours, minutes and seconds, the minutes and seconds each as two digits below 60 (`1:01:15.5`)

The cut SHALL be refused, and nothing added, when either time is empty or in no accepted form, or has more
than three decimals. It SHALL also be refused when its end is not after its start, when it shares more
than an instant with another cut of the clip that is not removed, or when it ends after the clip's length
once the page knows that length (below). A refusal SHALL be shown at the field it concerns, which SHALL
receive keyboard focus. It SHALL be announced, and it SHALL say what to type, which cut the new one overlaps,
or the clip's length. A cut that only touches another, the end of one being the start of the other, SHALL
be accepted. Times SHALL be compared to the millisecond, as they are typed and written, so a cut that starts
where another is shown to end touches it.

An added cut SHALL take its place in the list by its start, after every cut that starts at the same time or
earlier. It SHALL be saved with the reason `manual`. After an addition:

- both fields SHALL be empty again, with keyboard focus on the start field
- the addition SHALL be announced with the cut's times, the clip's name and its new cut count

**The clip's length.** No read of the service gives a clip's length. The page knows it only once the clip's
preview has read it from the clip's file in this Edit mode ("Edit mode previews a clip on request"). Until
then, the panel SHALL say that the page does not know the clip's length, that a cut that runs past the clip's
end stops there, and that a cut over the whole clip leaves the clip out of the movie, and it SHALL NOT refuse
a cut for its length. Once the page knows the length, the panel SHALL state it beside its fields, SHALL refuse
a cut that ends after it, and SHALL mark each listed cut that ends after it ("A clip's preview sets cut times
at the playhead and plays the clip as the movie will").

**Removing a cut.** Each cut SHALL offer **Remove**, which names the clip and the cut. A cut read from
`reel.yaml` SHALL then stay listed in its place, marked as removed when the edits are saved, with an **Undo**
that puts it back. Keyboard focus SHALL move to that Undo, and after an Undo to the cut's Remove. An Undo that
would make the cut share more than an instant with a cut added in this Edit mode SHALL be refused, as adding
that cut would be: the cut stays removed, keyboard focus stays on its Undo, and the refusal is shown in the
cut's row, announced, and names the cut to remove first. Two cuts read from `reel.yaml` that overlap there
SHALL NOT refuse each other's Undo: an Undo only goes back to what was read. A cut added in this Edit mode SHALL simply be gone.
Keyboard focus SHALL then move to the Remove of the cut that took its place, or of the cut before it, or to
the start field when no cut is left. Each removal and each Undo SHALL be
announced. After any addition, removal or Undo, the control holding keyboard focus SHALL be fully visible,
not covered by the page header, the chapter's heading or the save bar.

**Typed but not added.** While a panel's fields hold a typed time that was not added, the event SHALL count as
having unsaved changes. The save bar SHALL say that a cut was typed but not added, naming the clip as its row
names it when only one clip holds one, also after an edit that changes that name. Save, and Overwrite with mine after a conflict, SHALL say that they are unavailable until
the cut is added or its fields are cleared. Hiding the panel SHALL keep what was typed, and so SHALL moving the
clip to another chapter. The Cuts control of each clip whose panel holds such a time SHALL say so in words, at
every width and to assistive technology, also while its panel is hidden, so that the clip holding Save back
is found on its row. Reset SHALL empty every panel's fields.

While a save is in flight, the panel's fields, Add cut, Remove and Undo SHALL say that they are unavailable
and change nothing when used. The Cuts control SHALL still show and hide its panel, since that changes nothing
to save.

The Cuts control and every control in the panel SHALL take a tap anywhere in an area of at least 44 × 44 CSS
pixels around it when the primary pointer is coarse, reaching no other control, as every button does ("Every
control is large enough to touch"). With every panel hidden, the Cuts control SHALL NOT make a row taller in a
window 320 or 390 pixels wide. No panel SHALL make the page scroll horizontally from 320 pixels up.

#### Scenario: Opening a clip's cuts
- **WHEN** in Edit mode on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator presses the Cuts control of
  `s1710001.mp4`
- **THEN** a panel under its row says that the whole clip plays and offers a start and an end field and Add
  cut. Keyboard focus is still on the Cuts control, which says that its panel is shown.

#### Scenario: Adding a cut with typed times
- **WHEN** in that panel the operator types `0` as the start and `1,5` as the end and presses Enter
- **THEN**
  - the panel lists one cut, from `0:00` to `0:01.5`, 1.5 s long, its reason "Cut by hand"
  - the Cuts control reads "1 cut · −1.5 s"
  - both fields are empty, with keyboard focus on the start field
  - the addition is announced
  - the save bar says that 1 cut was added

#### Scenario: Every accepted form of a time
- **WHEN** on `s1710002.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator adds a cut from ` 0:00:01.25 `
  to `0:02.5`, and then one from `4` to `0:06`
- **THEN** the panel lists the cuts from `0:01.25` to `0:02.5` and from `0:04` to `0:06`, in that order, and the
  Cuts control reads "2 cuts · −3.25 s"

#### Scenario: A time the page cannot read
- **WHEN** on `s1710002.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator types `1:5` as the start and
  `2` as the end and asks to add the cut, then types `-1` as the start, then `0.1234`
- **THEN** each is refused at the start field, which keeps keyboard focus. The first two are refused as no time
  the page can read, naming the three forms. The last is refused for its four decimals. No cut is added.

#### Scenario: A cut that does not end after it starts
- **WHEN** on `s1710002.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator types `3` as the start and
  `2` as the end and asks to add the cut
- **THEN** the cut is refused at the end field, which receives keyboard focus, saying that a cut must end after
  it starts, and no cut is added

#### Scenario: A clip never previewed is not checked for length
- **WHEN** on `s1710002.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, whose preview was not opened in this Edit
  mode, the operator adds a cut from `5` to `7`
- **THEN** the cut is accepted and listed, and the panel says that the page does not know the clip's length and
  that a cut that runs past the clip's end stops there

#### Scenario: A cut that overlaps another
- **WHEN** `s1710001.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` has a cut from `0:00` to `0:01.5`, and the
  operator adds one from `1` to `2`
- **THEN** it is refused, saying that it overlaps cut 1 (`0:00` to `0:01.5`)
- **WHEN** the operator then adds one from `1.5` to `2`
- **THEN** it is accepted and listed second

#### Scenario: Removing a cut read from reel.yaml, and undoing it
- **WHEN** the `reel.yaml` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` gives `s1710003.mp4` a cut from 0 to 1.2
  seconds with the reason `black`, and in Edit mode the operator presses that cut's Remove
- **THEN** the cut stays listed, marked as removed when the edits are saved, with an Undo that has keyboard
  focus, and the save bar says that 1 cut is removed
- **WHEN** the operator presses that Undo
- **THEN** the cut is listed as before, its reason "Black frames", keyboard focus is on its Remove, and the page
  shows no unsaved changes

#### Scenario: An Undo that would overlap is refused
- **WHEN** with that same `reel.yaml`, the operator removes the cut from 0 to 1.2 seconds of `s1710003.mp4`, adds
  one from `1` to `2`, and presses the removed cut's Undo
- **THEN** the Undo is refused, saying that cut 1 overlaps cut 2 (`0:01` to `0:02`) and that cut 2 must be
  removed first. Cut 1 stays removed, keyboard focus stays on its Undo, and the save bar still says that 1 cut
  was added and 1 removed.

#### Scenario: Read cuts that overlap do not refuse each other's Undo
- **WHEN** the `reel.yaml` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` gives `s1710002.mp4` cuts from 0 to 3 seconds
  and from 2 to 4 seconds, and the operator removes both and presses each one's Undo
- **THEN** both are listed as before, and the page shows no unsaved changes

#### Scenario: A cut starts where another is shown to end
- **WHEN** the `reel.yaml` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` gives `s1710003.mp4` a cut from 0 to 3.2033333
  seconds, listed as ending at `0:03.203`, and the operator adds one from `3.203` to `4`
- **THEN** it is accepted and listed second

#### Scenario: Removing a cut added in this Edit mode
- **WHEN** on `s1710001.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator adds a cut from `0` to `1.5`
  and presses its Remove
- **THEN** the panel says that the whole clip plays again, keyboard focus is on the start field, and the page
  shows no unsaved changes

#### Scenario: A missing clip's cuts are shown, not edited
- **WHEN** the `reel.yaml` of `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov` gives the missing `borttagen.mp4` a cut from 0 to 2
  seconds, and the operator opens Edit mode
- **THEN** the row of `borttagen.mp4` says that it has 1 cut and offers Remove but no Cuts control, while
  `s1710002.mp4` and `s1710004.mp4` offer theirs
- **WHEN** the operator presses Remove on `borttagen.mp4`
- **THEN** its row is listed as removed when the edits are saved and no longer says that it has a cut

#### Scenario: An excluded clip offers no cuts
- **WHEN** the operator enters Edit mode on an event whose `reel.yaml` excludes `s1710002.mp4`, which is on
  disk and has a cut from `0` to `1.5`
- **THEN** its row offers no Cuts control and shows no cut count, the other clips of the chapter still offer
  theirs, and saving another edit writes the cut back unchanged

#### Scenario: An ignored clip has no cuts
- **WHEN** Edit mode opens on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`
- **THEN** the ignored `s1710004.mp4` offers no Cuts control, and every clip `Main` and `Kvällen` play offers one,
  the new `Kvällen/s1710004.mp4` included

#### Scenario: A cut typed but not added holds Save back
- **WHEN** on `s1710001.mp4` of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator types `2` as the start, adds
  nothing, and hides the panel
- **THEN** the save bar says that a cut was typed on `s1710001.mp4` but not added, and Save says that it is
  unavailable. Opening the panel again shows `2` in the start field.
- **WHEN** the operator then presses the browser's Back
- **THEN** the page stays and asks "Discard unsaved changes?"

#### Scenario: A typed cut moves with its clip
- **WHEN** on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, the operator types `2` as the start of a cut on
  `Kvällen/s1710002.mp4`, which `Kvällen` names `s1710002.mp4`, adds nothing, and moves that clip to `Main`
  with Move clips
- **THEN** the save bar now says that a cut was typed on `Kvällen/s1710002.mp4` but not added, Save says that
  it is unavailable, and the clip's Cuts panel, now in `Main`, is still shown with `2` in the start field

#### Scenario: Hidden panels holding typed text are marked on their rows
- **WHEN** on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, the operator types `5` in the start field of `s1710002.mp4`
  and hides its panel, then types `1:00` in the start field of `s1710004.mp4` and hides that panel
- **THEN** the save bar says that cuts were typed on 2 clips but not added, and the Cuts controls of those two
  clips, and of no other, say "typed" and that a cut was typed but not added
- **WHEN** the operator clears the field of `s1710002.mp4`
- **THEN** its Cuts control no longer says so, and the save bar names `s1710004.mp4`

#### Scenario: Cut controls wait for a save
- **WHEN** on `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, with a cut added to `s1710001.mp4` and its panel shown, the
  operator presses Save and the service has not answered yet
- **THEN** the start and end fields, Add cut and the cut's Remove say that they are unavailable, typing and
  pressing them change nothing, and the Cuts control still hides and shows the panel

#### Scenario: Cuts on a phone
- **WHEN** Edit mode opens on `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` on a touch screen 320 pixels wide
- **THEN** each clip row is as tall as on the page before this change, and a tap anywhere in a 44 × 44 pixel area
  around the Cuts control of `Kvällen/s1710002.mp4` reaches that control and no other
- **WHEN** the operator opens that panel and adds a cut from `0` to `1`
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally, and a tap anywhere in a 44 × 44 pixel area around each of the
  panel's fields, Add cut and the cut's Remove reaches that control and no other

### Requirement: The event page shows each clip's cuts

The event page SHALL show, beside the name of each clip that has cuts in `reel.yaml` and that `reel.yaml`
does not exclude, how many cuts it has and
how much time they cut out ("2 cuts · −4.5 s"), counted as Edit mode counts them. On request, the page SHALL
show the clip's cuts there, as Edit mode lists them, without any control that changes them. A clip without
cuts SHALL show nothing more than before, and so SHALL an excluded clip: it is not in the movie, so its cuts
do not apply. The indicator SHALL be operable from the keyboard. It SHALL say to
assistive technology whether the list is shown, and it SHALL be read as the number of cuts and the time cut
out, not as a minus sign. When the primary pointer is coarse, it SHALL take a tap anywhere in an area of at
least 44 × 44 CSS pixels around it, reaching no other control. No shown list SHALL make the page scroll
horizontally from 320 pixels up, whatever the length of its times.

The page SHALL read the cuts from the service each time it reads the event, after the event read, and SHALL
keep showing the cuts it read last until the new read answers. That read SHALL NOT write anything, as no read
does ("Reading a screen never changes state"). When it fails, the page SHALL show the event's clips without
cuts, with a note that says the cuts could not be read and why. The note is part of the page's content, not an
alert.

#### Scenario: A clip's cuts on the event page
- **WHEN** the operator has saved a cut from `0` to `1.5` on `s1710001.mp4` of
  `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`
- **THEN** the event page shows "1 cut · −1.5 s" beside `s1710001.mp4` and nothing beside its other clips
- **WHEN** the operator activates that indicator from the keyboard
- **THEN** it says that its list is shown, and lists the cut from `0:00` to `0:01.5`, 1.5 s long, "Cut by hand",
  with no control to change it

#### Scenario: An excluded clip shows no cuts
- **WHEN** `reel.yaml` excludes `s1710002.mp4` and holds a cut from `0` to `1.5` on it
- **THEN** the event page shows no cut indicator beside `s1710002.mp4`

#### Scenario: The cuts cannot be read
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` and the service does not answer the read of
  its cuts
- **THEN** the page shows its chapters and clips, with a note that the cuts could not be read because the
  service is not reachable, and nothing is announced as an alert

#### Scenario: Reading cuts changes nothing
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, opens a clip's cut list, refreshes the page
  and goes back to the list
- **THEN** every request the client made was a read, and no file under the library changed

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: An event's page schedules its render
**Reason**: Replaced by "An event's page schedules its render, held back only by clips a render needs". The requirement said that every missing clip, an excluded one included, holds Render back, because the event read did not say which missing clips are excluded; it now does (`blocking_missing`), and the scenario "An excluded missing clip still holds Render back" is its opposite. A MODIFIED block cannot drop or rename that scenario, so the requirement is re-stated under a new name.
**Migration**: None for clients; the other behaviour of the requirement is carried over unchanged into the new one.
