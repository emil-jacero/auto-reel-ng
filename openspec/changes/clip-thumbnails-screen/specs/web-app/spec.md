## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Every clip row shows a frame from its clip

On an event's page, every clip row SHALL show a thumbnail of the clip beside its facts, after its position
number and ahead of its file name in the row's reading order. This applies to the chapter tables, to their
card layout in a narrow window, and to Edit mode's lists (the movable rows and the ignored rows). The
thumbnail SHALL be the image the service returns for that clip from
`GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}/thumbnail?clip=<identity>`. The event id and the clip's full identity SHALL
be sent exactly as the event detail gives them, including a chapter folder and non-ASCII letters. The
request SHALL also carry the clip's modification time, exactly as the event detail gives it, as the `v`
parameter, so that a clip replaced on disk gets a new address. The client SHALL NOT choose, crop or compute
the frame itself.

The thumbnail SHALL be shown in a box of fixed 16:9 proportions, of the same size in every row. The whole
image SHALL be visible inside the box, never cropped or stretched. A clip displayed in portrait, such as a
phone clip whose container rotates it, SHALL appear as a player shows it, whole, with empty bands at its
sides.

Each thumbnail image SHALL have the text alternative "Frame from <file name>". The thumbnail SHALL NOT be
focusable, and SHALL NOT start a drag of its own. In Edit mode a clip moves only by its handle or its move
buttons, and its thumbnail moves with its row.

A MISSING clip SHALL NOT request a thumbnail. Its row SHALL show an empty placeholder box of the same size,
and its status says why the box is empty. An IGNORED clip's thumbnail SHALL be dimmed, like the rest of its
row.

#### Scenario: Each clip of an event shows its frame
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`
- **THEN** each of its four clip rows shows an image whose text alternative is "Frame from <its file name>",
  with one thumbnail request per clip carrying that clip's identity, and as `v` that clip's modification time
  exactly as the event detail gives it

#### Scenario: Chapter clips are asked for by their full identity
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`
- **THEN** the `Kvällen` table's rows request their thumbnails with identities that start with `Kvällen/`,
  including the NEW `Kvällen/s1710004.mp4`, and each row shows the image for its own clip

#### Scenario: An ignored clip's frame is dimmed
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, whose root clip `s1710004.mp4` is IGNORED
- **THEN** that row shows its thumbnail dimmed together with the row's other facts, and the other rows'
  thumbnails are not dimmed

#### Scenario: A missing clip requests nothing
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-09-01 - Sommarlov`, whose `reel.yaml` lists `borttagen.mp4` that is not
  on disk
- **THEN** no thumbnail request names `borttagen.mp4`, its row shows an empty placeholder box of the same size
  as the others, and every other clip's row shows its frame

#### Scenario: Edit mode keeps each frame with its clip
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`, enters Edit mode, and moves its first clip
  down one place with the Move down button
- **THEN** every drag row shows the same frame its clip showed in the table, the moved clip's frame is now in
  the second row, and the service received no second thumbnail request for any of the four clips

#### Scenario: A clip rotated for display is shown whole
- **WHEN** an event holds a 1920×1080 clip whose container rotates it 90° for display, named with a space,
  a comma and a Swedish letter (`stående klipp, 1.mp4`)
- **THEN** its thumbnail is requested with that name as its `clip` value and arrives taller than wide, its
  box has the same size as a landscape clip's, and the whole frame is visible inside it, turned as a player
  shows it, with empty bands at its sides

### Requirement: Thumbnails never hold up or break a page

Thumbnails SHALL NOT delay the event page. Its chapters and clip facts SHALL be shown as soon as the event
detail is read, whether or not any thumbnail has arrived. The page SHALL request a clip's thumbnail only when
its row is on or near the visible part of the page. A clip's thumbnail SHALL have the same address every time
it is shown while the clip is unchanged on disk, so that a row shown again (after a Refresh, or on entering or leaving Edit mode) is served from
the browser's cache while the service's caching headers allow it.

While a thumbnail loads, its box SHALL show a placeholder. That placeholder SHALL stand still when the
operating system asks for reduced motion. A row SHALL NOT change size or position when its thumbnail
arrives, or when it fails.

When the service cannot give a clip's thumbnail (it answers with a failure status, or the image cannot be
shown), the box SHALL show a neutral "No preview" placeholder with an icon, named "No preview for <file
name>" for assistive technology. The failure SHALL NOT raise an alert or a toast, SHALL NOT change the
clip's status, and SHALL NOT be retried automatically while the row stays shown.

In a window 390 CSS pixels wide, the thumbnail SHALL stay in the clip's row beside its facts, without
horizontal scroll, and no fact of a row SHALL overlap another.

#### Scenario: A clip whose frame cannot be read says "No preview"
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-10-05 - Trasig`, whose only clip `trasig.mp4` is an empty file
- **THEN** the row shows the "No preview" placeholder with its icon, its status and facts read as before, the
  page shows no alert or toast about it, and the service received exactly one thumbnail request for
  `trasig.mp4`

#### Scenario: Only rows near the view are requested
- **WHEN** the operator opens an event of 60 clips in one chapter, in a window 1280 by 800 pixels, and then
  scrolls to its end
- **THEN** fewer than 60 thumbnails are requested before the scroll, and all 60 after it

#### Scenario: Arriving thumbnails move nothing
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` and every thumbnail arrives after the clip
  facts are shown
- **THEN** no clip row changes its size or position as the images arrive

#### Scenario: A slow thumbnail does not hold up the page
- **WHEN** every thumbnail response of `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar` is held back for five seconds
- **THEN** the page shows its heading, verdict and all four clip rows with their facts before the images,
  and each box shows the loading placeholder until its image arrives

#### Scenario: Placeholders stand still under reduced motion
- **WHEN** the operator's system asks for reduced motion and thumbnails are loading
- **THEN** their placeholders are shown without any animation

#### Scenario: Thumbnails at phone width
- **WHEN** the operator opens `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn` in a window 390 pixels wide, in the table
  view and in Edit mode
- **THEN** the page does not scroll horizontally, every clip still shows its thumbnail, position, file name,
  status, size and modification time in its row, and no two of them overlap

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Reading a screen never changes state

Opening, refreshing, returning to, or moving between screens SHALL NOT write any file, enqueue or cancel any
job, or change any state the service holds. Such state SHALL change only through an explicit operator action
on a control that names what it does. The theme choice is a preference kept in the browser, not service
state.

The one exception is the service's thumbnail cache. Reading a clip's thumbnail MAY make the service extract
the frame and store it there. That cache is derived and rebuildable, lives outside the library, and is not
editorial or job state. Reading a screen SHALL still write nothing under the library.

The screens SHALL NOT re-read on a timer. A server push channel the client subscribes to is not polling.

#### Scenario: Browsing the dev library changes nothing
- **WHEN** the operator opens the list, refreshes it, switches it to Needs render, opens
  `2024-08-20 - Två kapitel - Tjörn`, refreshes that page, and goes back
- **THEN** every request the client made was a read, no file under the library changed, and the jobs the
  service lists are the same as before

#### Scenario: Thumbnails fill only the service's cache
- **WHEN** the service's thumbnail cache is empty and the operator opens `2024-06-27 - Grillning med grannar`
- **THEN** the cache holds a thumbnail for each of its four clips, no file under the library changed, and the
  jobs the service lists are the same as before

#### Scenario: An idle screen makes no requests
- **WHEN** the event list is shown, no job runs, and the operator does nothing for a minute
- **THEN** the client makes no HTTP request during that minute
