## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Events read model is scanned from disk per request
`GET /api/v1/events` SHALL enumerate events by walking the configured ingest layout at request time, and
`GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` SHALL parse the event's current `reel.yaml` (seeding metadata from the
folder name when absent, as `scan` does) — returning metadata, ordered chapters/clips, reconcile state
(NEW/MISSING), and the event's **staleness verdict** (fresh, or stale with the changed components as
reasons, from the staleness gate and render manifest). The event identity in URLs SHALL be the
root-relative event directory (URL-encoded). The service MUST NOT maintain a database copy of event or
clip state, and responses MUST reflect disk changes made since any previous request. Events reads SHALL be
read-only: no request may create or modify `reel.yaml` or the render manifest.

Each clip in the detail response SHALL additionally carry the clip file's **byte size** and **modification
time** (timezone-aware, UTC), read from the file's own directory entry. These are file facts, not media
facts: no clip may be decoded or probed to produce them, so the detail response stays probe-free. A clip the
document references but which is absent from disk SHALL report both as null rather than a substituted zero
or epoch — absence is reported, never fabricated. The events **list** response SHALL NOT carry per-clip
facts; it keeps its clip counts.

#### Scenario: Disk edit is visible on the next request
- **WHEN** an event's `reel.yaml` title is edited on disk after a previous GET
- **THEN** the next `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` returns the new title

#### Scenario: Staleness is part of the event detail
- **WHEN** an event's clips changed since its last render
- **THEN** `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` reports it stale citing the clip-set component

#### Scenario: Event identity round-trips with spaces and non-ASCII characters
- **WHEN** an event directory is named `2024/2024-06-21 - Midsommar i Dalarna`
- **THEN** the URL-encoded id returned by the list endpoint fetches that event's detail

#### Scenario: Unknown event yields 404
- **WHEN** `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}` names a directory that does not exist under the root
- **THEN** the response is 404 with a problem body

#### Scenario: Scan failure is loud, never fabricated
- **WHEN** an event's `reel.yaml` is unparseable
- **THEN** the response is an error naming the failing event, not an empty or partial success

#### Scenario: Clips carry the file facts a reorder view needs
- **WHEN** an event holds three clips named `P1000123.MP4`, `P1000124.MP4` and `P1000125.MP4`, written to
  disk in an order that does not match their names
- **THEN** each clip in the detail response carries its own byte size and modification time, so a client can
  present them in the order they were shot rather than the order they are named

#### Scenario: A clip missing from disk reports no file facts
- **WHEN** the document references a clip whose file has been deleted or renamed
- **THEN** that clip is still reported MISSING, and its size and modification time are both null

#### Scenario: A disk-only NEW clip carries file facts like any other
- **WHEN** a clip exists on disk but is not yet referenced by `reel.yaml`
- **THEN** it appears in the detail response as NEW, carrying its size and modification time

#### Scenario: File facts cost no probe
- **WHEN** an event's clips are truncated, header-damaged, or otherwise undecodable
- **THEN** the detail response still returns their size and modification time and does not fail, because no
  clip was decoded to produce them

### Requirement: Conditional editorial write
The write endpoint SHALL accept an optional `If-Match` request header carrying an ETag obtained from the
editorial read endpoint. When the header is present and matches the event's current editorial state, the write
SHALL proceed. When it is present and does not match, the service SHALL respond `412 Precondition Failed` with
a problem body and leave `reel.yaml` byte-for-byte unchanged. When the header is absent, the write SHALL be
unconditional exactly as before, so scripted clients and any CLI-equivalent caller keep working without it.
The ETag SHALL identify the **editorial** state canonically: a comment-only or formatting-only edit to
`reel.yaml` MUST NOT change it, while any change to metadata, chapters, clip order, per-clip properties,
`ignore`, or `look` MUST change it.

A **successful** write SHALL carry an `ETag` response header identifying the editorial state it persisted —
the same value a read of that event would then return. A client may therefore chain conditional writes,
using the tag from one write as the precondition for the next, without an intervening read. A write refused
with `412` SHALL NOT carry an `ETag`: a client that lost the race MUST re-read the document it is about to
overwrite, not retry blindly against a tag the service handed it.

#### Scenario: A concurrent write is refused, not clobbered
- **WHEN** a client reads the document, another writer adds analysis trims to the same event, and the client
  then PUTs its edited state with the `If-Match` it originally received
- **THEN** the response is 412, and the trims added in the meantime are still on disk

#### Scenario: A matching precondition writes
- **WHEN** a client PUTs with the `If-Match` from a read whose state has not changed since
- **THEN** the write is applied and the response is the usual persisted-document echo with its staleness
  verdict

#### Scenario: An absent precondition is unconditional
- **WHEN** a client PUTs with no `If-Match` header
- **THEN** the write is applied regardless of any intervening change, matching the endpoint's existing
  behaviour

#### Scenario: A comment-only edit does not invalidate a held ETag
- **WHEN** a comment is added by hand to an event's `reel.yaml` after a client read it, and the client PUTs
  with the `If-Match` from that read
- **THEN** the write proceeds, because the editorial state did not change

#### Scenario: A round trip is enough to obtain a fresh precondition
- **WHEN** a client receives 412, re-reads the editorial document, re-applies its edit, and PUTs with the new
  `If-Match`
- **THEN** the write succeeds

#### Scenario: Consecutive conditional writes need no intervening read
- **WHEN** a client reorders an event's clips, PUTs with the `If-Match` from its read, then reorders again
  and PUTs with the `ETag` the first write returned
- **THEN** both writes are applied, and no read of `/reel` occurred between them

#### Scenario: The write's tag is the tag a read would give
- **WHEN** a client PUTs an editorial change and then reads `GET /api/v1/events/{event_id}/reel`
- **THEN** the read's `ETag` equals the one the write returned

#### Scenario: An unmodified save returns the tag it was given
- **WHEN** a client PUTs the document exactly as it read it
- **THEN** the write's `ETag` equals the read's, because the editorial state did not change

#### Scenario: A refused write hands back no precondition
- **WHEN** a write is refused with 412 because the event changed since the client's read
- **THEN** the response carries no `ETag`, so the client cannot retry without re-reading
